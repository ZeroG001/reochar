          <p>The Real Estate One Charitable Foundation wa established in 2004 in honor of the celebration of the 75th Anniversary of the Real Estate One Family of Companies. Donations to the Foundation provide an opportunity for our owners, the Elsea Family, our corporate staff, and our sales associates to give back to our communities where we work and live.<br /><br /></p>
                    
            </p><p><strong>History</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>Real Estate One is the largest Real Estate company in Michigan with more than 2000 employees and sales associates. Since our inception in 1929, we have been actively involved in Michigan communities for over 80 years.  Real Estate One is a full-service real estate broker and our Family of Companies include Max Broock Realtors, Johnstone and Johnstone Realtors, John Adams Mortgage Company, Capital Title Insurance Agency, Insurance One, Inc.  and Relocation America. <br />

The contributions of time, talent and treasure of the generous individuals in our organization have provided an enviable recognition for Real Estate One’s family of companies in Michigan. We are known as a company that “lives and works” in the community.  <br />

Since our formation in 2004, our Corporation has continually contributed to our charity partners.  The word  ‘Family’ is a key component to of the Real Estate One Family of Companies. It punctuates our dedication not only to one another during difficult times, but also our willingness to assist those who have been less fortunate in the 200 communities we serve," stated Stuart Elsea, President of Financial Services. “We are extremely proud of our relationship (with our partner charities) and have tremendous respect for the employees who give their time, skill and passion to these charities. These individuals represent the best of humanity and a level of character we should all strive to emulate in our own lives. The charities were chosen based on their diversity of activities, the efficient use of funds, and their community contribution to all segments of our society. <br />

Our largest fundraiser is the Annual Fall Employee Pledge Drive. Both the 2009 and 2010 Pledge Drives averaged over $60,000.00 to our charities.  In addition, a myriad of fund-raisers by area offices add an average of $40,000 in donations to our Pledge Drives to be distributed to our charity partners. The REO Corporation also matches a percentage of donations by our employees.  <br /><br />
<strong>Imagine Your Gift Making a Difference</strong><br />
We invite you to join us in supporting our chosen charities and to help make an important difference in the communities where we work and play.

    </p><br />
 <p><small>The Real Estate One Charitable Foundation is a 501(C)(3) non-profit organization and is registered with the State of Michigan and the Internal Revenue Service. 100% of the contributions to the REOCF go directly to our four major charity partners and other non-profits on a special request basis.</small>
